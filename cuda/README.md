# CUDA Practice Dump
A public facing CUDA practice dump. It's time to go [CUDA MODE](https://github.com/cuda-mode)

# Setup

Head over to [SETUP.md](setup.md)

# TODO
I'm following resources linked in the [resource-stream](https://github.com/cuda-mode/resource-stream)
- [x] How GPU Computing Works | GTC 2021
- [ ] How CUDA Computing Works | GTC 2022
- [x] GPU Performance Background User's Guide
- [ ] [Writing code that runs fast on a GPU](https://youtu.be/8sDg-lD1fZQ?si=8e5t2CXsgS6-2cYV)

# Learning Plan
- [ ] Start with exercises in "CUDA by example"
- [ ] Understand the basics of profiling and debugging cuda code
